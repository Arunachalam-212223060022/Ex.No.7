# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

#AI Tools Required: 


# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.
# PROMPT:
Build a responsive, modern AI Productivity Dashboard web app using React + Tailwind CSS with a minimal, glassmorphism design in shades of purple, blue, and pink.

✨ Features to include:
1. **Left Sidebar Navigation**
   - App name: "Productivity"
   - User avatar and email displayed (example: xyz@gmail.com)
   - Navigation buttons: Dashboard, Tasks, Calendar, Settings
   - Active tab highlighted with a gradient purple glow.

2. **Main Dashboard Layout**
   - Two-column responsive layout:
     - **Left Panel (AI Chat + Reminders)**
       - AI Chat assistant box:
         - Conversation style chat interface with timestamped messages.
         - Input box with placeholder: "Add task with natural language..."
         - Example message: “Prepare CSE notes before 9 PM today.”
         - Assistant confirmation message: “Got it! I’ve added ‘CSE notes today’ to your tasks. Deadline set for Mon, Nov 10, 9:00 PM.”
       - Below the chat: **Reminders Section**
         - Card layout for tasks (example: “CSE notes today”).
         - Shows deadline time (like “12h left”).
         - Buttons for "Complete" and "Snooze".
         - Use soft golden gradient for reminder cards.

     - **Right Panel (Countdown Timer + Music Player)**
       - **Countdown Timer Section**
         - Title: “Set countdown time (minutes)”
         - Input box for minutes (default: 5)
         - Large digital timer display (e.g., 05:00)
         - Circular progress animation around timer
         - “Start” button with hover glow effect
       - **Music Player Section**
         - Simple card with title “Music Player”
         - Include basic controls (Play, Pause, Next)
         - Animated waveform or equalizer visualization in purple tones.

3. **Top Right Corner**
   - Display current time dynamically (e.g., “Current Time: 8:59 AM”).

4. **General Design**
   - Use Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion for smooth animations.
   - Rounded corners, subtle shadows, and blurred glass background.
   - Font: “Poppins” or “DM Sans”.
   - Color palette: #9b5de5 (violet), #5d4be3 (blue), #f15bb5 (pink), #2a1a40 (background gradient).
   - Layout should adapt for desktop and tablet.

🧠 Functionality:
- Use React state for chat, reminders, and timer logic.
- Countdown timer starts and updates visually.
- Tasks can be marked as complete or snoozed.
- Simulate AI chat messages with slight delays using setTimeout().
- Display dynamic current time using JavaScript Date object.
- Optional: Use localStorage to persist tasks between refreshes.

📦 Structure:
- `Sidebar.js` – Navigation and user info.
- `Dashboard.js` – Main layout combining AI Chat, Reminders, Timer, and Music Player.
- `Timer.js` – Countdown logic with progress circle.
- `MusicPlayer.js` – Simple player with dummy song list.
- `ChatBot.js` – Mock AI chat interface.
- `Reminders.js` – Task list with complete/snooze buttons.

🧩 Bonus (if possible):
- Add gradient transitions when switching tabs.
- Animate countdown completion with confetti or glow.
- Add subtle background particles for aesthetic appeal.
